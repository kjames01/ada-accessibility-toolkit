# Project

This project has Agent Teams enabled for parallel multi-agent collaboration.

## Agent Teams Guidelines

- **Coordinate via the shared task list** - all agents should claim tasks before starting work
- **Avoid file conflicts** - each teammate should own distinct files; never have two agents editing the same file
- **Report findings** - teammates should message the lead with summaries when completing tasks
- **Size tasks appropriately** - aim for self-contained units that produce a clear deliverable
